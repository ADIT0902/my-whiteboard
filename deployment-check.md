# How to Check and Update Your Vercel Deployment

## 1. Check if Changes are Deployed

Visit your Vercel deployment URL and:
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Go to the Network tab
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check if the latest changes are reflected

## 2. Force Redeploy on Vercel

### Option A: Through Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Log into your account
3. Find your whiteboard project
4. Go to the "Deployments" tab
5. Click the three dots (...) on the latest deployment
6. Select "Redeploy"

### Option B: Push Changes to Git (Recommended)
If your project is connected to a Git repository:

1. Make sure all changes are committed:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix landing page routing and navigation"
git push origin main
```

2. Vercel will automatically redeploy when you push to your connected branch

### Option C: Using Vercel CLI
If you have Vercel CLI installed:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## 3. Clear Browser Cache

After redeployment:
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Or open your deployment URL in an incognito/private window
3. Test the landing page functionality

## 4. Verify the Fix

On your deployed site:
1. Go to the landing page
2. If logged in, click "Get Started" - should go to `/whiteboard`
3. If not logged in, click "Get Started" - should go to `/register`
4. Check that all routes work properly

## 5. Common Issues

- **Changes not showing**: Wait 2-3 minutes after deployment
- **Still seeing old version**: Clear browser cache completely
- **Build errors**: Check Vercel deployment logs in the dashboard

The key changes that should now be live:
- Landing page "Get Started" button navigates to `/whiteboard` for logged-in users
- Cleaned up routing structure
- Removed duplicate components
